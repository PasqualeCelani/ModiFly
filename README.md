# ModiFly
ModiFly is a simulator designed to test a new Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) model that moves beyond traditional, joystick-based interfaces. The project leverages natural human communication modalities, specifically gestures and speech, to create a more intuitive and seamless control experience. The system is designed to be low-cost, easy to use, and capable of running on low-end hardware.
